  "The objectives of the Project surround the development of the WRIO Internet OS platform (technical aspect) and the implementation of the step-by-step \"The Alternative\" instructions (conceptual aspect), to build a free, decentralized, transparent and at the same time anonymous self-regulatory society. A society where the most efficient participation strategy is through mutually beneficial cooperation, and where financial and legal guarantors represented by the state and the bank are not needed. Their functions are carried out through Smart Contracts based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The Project is designed to become an alternative to and a replacement of the the obsolete, inefficient, centralized and corrupt government control based on coercion and regulation."

In general, cantons are relatively small in terms of area and population when compared with other administrative divisions such as counties, departments, or provinces. Internationally, the best-known cantons — and the most politically important — are those of Switzerland. As the constituents of the Swiss Confederation, theoretically (and historically), the Swiss cantons are semi-sovereign states. The Alternative cantons continue and elaborate the concept of self-regulated communities, and will act as virtual, and, in good time, autonomous territorial units with their own set of simple and unambiguously defined laws implemented through Smart Contracts.",
