  "The objectives of the Project surround the development of the WRIO Internet OS platform (technical aspect) and the implementation of the step-by-step \"The Alternative\" instructions (conceptual aspect), to build a free, decentralized, transparent and at the same time anonymous self-regulatory society. A society where the most efficient participation strategy is through mutually beneficial cooperation, and where financial and legal guarantors represented by the state and the bank are not needed. Their functions are carried out through Smart Contracts based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The Project is designed to become an alternative to and a replacement of the the obsolete, inefficient, centralized and corrupt government control based on coercion and regulation."

The emerging opportunity to conduct transactions without intermediaries (banks) was the missing link that gave rise to a market free from governmental regulations.",

Having started with the sales of illicit goods, the crypto-economy has spread its influence to the ordinary markets of goods and services. Instead of KYC, free marketplaces use self-regulated reputational schemes. They demonstrated that there was no need for the identification of the parties or an intermediary with the monopoly.

Assignment of rights will not require notary certification, while at the same time it will be possible to trace the full history of the item: from the receipt of raw materials used in the production to the disposal; from womb to tomb. Yet, the most important feature of the crypto-economy is the possibility to keep transparent the history of obtaining such an intangible asset as reputation. Until recently, every person had only a subjective and small network of trust relations based on personal experiences of interacting with other members of society. Today, blockchain technology makes it possible to create an unchangeable database of collective memory of P2P transactions where reputational tokens act as “neurons”.

If at the time of Web 1.0 a company could not do without a website, at the time of Web 2.0 it had to have a page in social media, then during the era of Web 3.0 a company without a reputation is a commercial corpse. And while earlier the achievement of maximum profit performance often required the development of the worst sides of human nature, the reputational model will fix it. Companies focused on public interests will have a competitive advantage, while those who trample upon them will be foredoomed. Reputation will replace money capital, and the public opinion will take an express shape in a single figure that will be the best advertisement of society-friendly companies and will outmatch the advertising budget of any other. A high reputation will be more than just a guarantee of goods and services quality. It will be a pledge of reputational growth for its clients and employees. Besides, teamed up with the Rating, the reputation will replace already outdated references and CVs.",

  "Just like the economic incentive made Bitcoin the first decentralized cryptocurrency, reputation paved the way for the first economic system based on the “non-zero sum game”. A monetary economy is a “zero sum game” – a game where a gain of one participant is balanced by the loss of another. An example may be a bet: if you win a certain sum, then somebody loses the same sum. In a non-zero sum game the total value of the game may change, which provides a benefit to one participant, while it does not take it away from another. Chess may serve as a good example here; turning a pawn into a queen, one player increases the total strength of its chess pieces, while the other player loses nothing. In non-zero sum games the loss of one of the players is not a prerequisite, though such an outcome may not be excluded."
